This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}

#this is abandoned and replaced with harris corner dectection in OpenCV
library(data.table)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(Momocs)
library(EBImage)

#import images
img_dir <- dir_images <- "C:/Users/ouwen/Desktop/images" #;dir_images
dir_names <- list.files(dir_images)#;dir_names
breed_name <- rep(NA, length(dir_names))



img_test_dir <- img_train_dir <- "~/Desktop/project3/images/"
img_name <- testname


    #read images
    img <- readImage(paste0(img_dir,img_name)[i]) #;display(mat)

    
    #High-pass Laplacian filtering
    f_high <- matrix(1, nc=3, nr=3)
    f_high[2,2] <- -8
    img <- filter2(img, f_high)

}

```
